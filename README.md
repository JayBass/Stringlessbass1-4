Stringlessbass1-4
=================

First stable version 
A new type of bass instrument to bridge the gap between stringed instruments and key-based controllers.

Pine "neck" measuring in at 24 inches houses the arduino unit, breadboard and conductive foam sensors. To select a note, simply put your finger on the correct sensor. The Arduino will in turn detect data from the change in resistance on the sensors, translating into a numerical value to trigger 
a sample in PureData.

All sensors are connected to an Arduino board, which will in turn be connected to a computer via usb running PureData. The beauty of this instrument is itâ€™s versatility. The player will be able to load various sound patches for bass and potentially other instruments such as bass synths, 
enabling the player to experiment with another input method as opposed to a conventional MIDI controller or MIDI pickup on a bass guitar, which notoriously do not track well and can cause detrimental long term affects to the finish of an existing instrument.
